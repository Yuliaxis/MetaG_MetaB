Analysis of shotgun metagenomics data of 60 faecal samples. 
Sixty Duroc pigs (30 immunocastrated males and 30 females) from the same genetic line were housed at the IRTA experimental farm. They were assigned to stress and control groups based on space allowance (stress = 1 m²/pig; control = 1.5 m²/pig). Additionally, pigs in the stress group underwent two mixing events during the growing-finishing period.
